# Examples
This directory contains examples showing off *Vue Component Development Kit*.

## Running the Examples
You don't have to build the examples to see them in action. Instead you can either:

- Go to the [official documentation](https://christiankienle.github.io/cdk/) and see them in action there or
- Run the Storybook.

## Rationale
Having a dedicated examples directory may seem a bit odd at first. Since we could also simply have the examples within the `docs` directory. However, since the examples are also used by the Storybook it makes more sense to have a central place for examples.

Using the examples as-is for the End-to-End-tests is not beeing done. End-to-End-tests are something different. They should follow best (E2E) best practices and can be more complex than simple examples.
