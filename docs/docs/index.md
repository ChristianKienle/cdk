The *Vue Component Development Kit* is a set of low-level components, mixins and utilities that act as a foundation for other component libraries and applications. Kickstart your project with a *well-tested*, *incrementally adoptable* and *minimally invasive* framework. Everything that is part of *Vue Component Development Kit* solves an actual problem that you may stumble upon sooner or later.

## What is in the Box
- **[Client Only](./components/client-only):** A component to wrap non SSR friendly components/markup.
- **[Focus Trap](./components/focus-trap):** Allows you to conveniently trap the focus within an element/component.
- **[Infinite Scroll](./components/infinite-scroll):** A component that makes to easy to have a infintely scrolling list of item.
- **[Link](./components/link):** A universal component for links to internal and external resources.
- **[List](./components/list):** A high–level component to render an infintely scrolling list of selectable items.
- **[Match Media](./components/match-media):** Use media queries the Vue way.
- **[Popover](./components/popover):** A low–level, generic popover component that can be used to implement dropdowns, menus, tooltips and much more.
- **[Scroll Container](./components/scroll-container):** A convenient way to create scrollable elements.

## Philosophy
Everything that is part of the *Vue Component Development Kit* (abbr. **CDK**) tries to conform to a certain philisophy.

### Every Package is useful on its own
Every package solves an actual problem and is useful on it's own. There are almost no (non–trivial) dependencies between the packages itself. This makes it easy to use just a single package, multiple packages or all.

### Every Package is well documented and well tested
Everything that is considered *public* is documented. If it isn't please create an inssue. Whenever *Vue Component Development Kit* relies on a third party library and the test coverage of that library is not sufficient, tests are created and contributed back to the project.
