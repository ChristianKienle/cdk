title: Vue Component Development Kit
---

The *Vue Component Development Kit* is a set of low-level components, mixins and utilities that act as a foundation for component libraries and applications. Kickstart your project with a *well-tested*, *incrementally adoptable* and *minimally invasive* framework.

## Features

- [Popover](./components/popover)

## Philosophy

Everything that is part of the *Vue Component Development Kit* (abbr. **CDK**) tries to conform to a certain philisophy:

- **Incrementally Adoptable:** *CDK* is made up of several packages. You can use just one, some or all packages. Each package is useful on its own.
- **No/Minimal Styling:** *CDK* avoids to introduce CSS styles as much as possible. CSS is only used (and included) where it is important for the actual functionality.
- **Solve an actual Problem:** A *CDK*-package solves an actual problem. A problem can be hard, error prone and/or tedious.
- **Well Tested:** You should not have to think twice whether or not something that is part of *CDK* is stable/production ready. *CDK* is well tested.
- **Outstanding Documentation:** Everything that has made it into *CDK* is well documented.
